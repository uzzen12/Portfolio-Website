                <p>Internet provides our daily lives with numerous positive impacts such as with the help of services like instant messaging apps and email and because of that it is the most effective way to communicate with people throughout the world. It even saves us vital amount of time when conducting
                any sort of business transaction. Our lives have become easier as we can shop for anything online

                television for that. Even the education sector has benefitted in a significant way as libraries of

                    <button onclick="Change1()">Next Image</button> <!--calling change function and creating button"-->
                    <p>One of the key issues associated with internet is online security and privacy. Privacy is something that is very important for our lives. Although social media has good impact, there are
                    people who use it inappropriate purposes. Personal information and pictures of people are posted
                    online without their consent. Criminal activities such as private data trafficking or social
                    media exploitation is also occurring at large. Online privacy and security has become crucial
                    for everyone and will only become more important moving forward. There is also a lot of easily
                    available content which are inappropriate and aren’t age suitable. There are also a lot of cases
                    where people have become addicted to social media which can negatively influence an individual’s
                    life. Cases where a person illegally uses the internet to hack into another person’s account to
                    steal their banking information and private details also happens frequently. Many instances
                    where people abuse the media platform to spread hate messages have also happened.</p>
